# Star Wing Game - Unity Implementation

**Course:** *Modeling and Visualization (MiV)*  
**University:** *URV*  

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this project is to reimplement the classic *Star Wing* video game using **Unity**, incorporating modern game development tools and techniques. This includes physics, collisions, PBR materials, post-processing effects, and gameplay mechanics.  

## üéÆ Project Description

This Unity-based project recreates **Practice 2 (OpenGL)**, utilizing Unity's powerful tools for 3D game development. The project includes the following features:  

### Key Features  
1. **3D Objects and Environments**  
   - Use of complex 3D models (not just primitives).  
   - Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials: Albedo, Normal Maps, Smoothness, Metallic, Ambient Occlusion, etc.  

2. **Gameplay Mechanics**  
   - Enemies capable of shooting when the player enters their range.  
   - Player and enemies have health components.  
   - The player can shoot in the ship's direction.  
   - A **Power-Up system** that enhances player projectiles.  
   - Bomb mechanic with a cooldown timer.  

3. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - Heads-Up Display (HUD): Displays the player‚Äôs health, bombs, and other relevant game information.  
   - (Optional) Start menu, Game Over menu, and Credits.  

4. **Game Progression**  
   - Eliminate all enemies to open a gate and complete the level.  

5. **Visual and Technical Enhancements**  
   - **3D Lighting** for improved visual fidelity.  
   - **Post-Processing Effects** like Bloom, Chromatic Aberration, etc.  

### Optional Features  
- Enemy patrolling and repositioning during attacks.  
- Additional menus and graphical polish.
